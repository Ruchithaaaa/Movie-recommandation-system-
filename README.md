# Movie-recommendation-system-

Recommendation systems changed the way we search for things that interest us. This is an information filtering approach used to predict that user's preferences. The most common areas where recommendation systems are applied are books, news, articles, music, videos, movies, etc. Here, we propose a movie recommendation system. It is based on a collaborative filtering approach that takes the information provided by the user, analyzes it, and recommends the most suitable movies for the user at that moment. The list of recommended movies is sorted by previous user's movies and uses the K-means algorithm for this purpose. this also helps users find selected movies based on other userâ€™s movie experience in an efficient way without wasting a lot of time on useless browsing. Users can easily browse recommendations to find movies they like.
